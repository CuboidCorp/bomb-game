      The objective is to help the agent move the cursor from the beginning of the
      labyrinth (Green square) to the end of the labyrinth (Blue squares) without
      going through the walls that the agent can not see. The current position in
      the labyrinth is shown through a blinking yellow square.

    m_Localized: This module is made of a blinking light, a long green button and
      a grid of 3x6 buttons. To disable this module, the agent needs to tell you
      how the light is blinking so you can find which character is associated using
      the morsepedia app. Once you have the character you need to find the group
      in which it belongs and describe the associated image so they can reproduce
      it. Once they have the same image they can confirm it by pressing the long
      green button.

    m_Localized: This module is made of a black screen with a number on it, as well
      as eight buttons with symbols on them. To defuse the module, the agent will
      need to tell you what the number on the screen is, and which symbols are on
      the buttons. The objective will then be to find a correct combination of symbols
      where the sum of their respective values is equal to the number, once found
      you can give it to the agent for them to press the buttons associated with
      the symbols to defuse the bomb once the number is reached.

      of the bomb, you will need to find the correct direction of rotation and the
      target value. To defuse this module the agent needs to turn the lock in the
      correct direction to reach the target value, the agent will hear a sound when
      done correctly. This process needs to be done three times, using the following
      instructions."
